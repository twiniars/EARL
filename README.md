## EARL: Embodied Agent-Based cybeR-physical Control Systems Modelling Language

EARL follows a Model-Driven Software Development approach (MDSD), which facilitates cyberphysical control system development. It is based on a mathematical method of robot controller specification, employing the concept of an Embodied Agent, and a graphical modelling language: System Modelling Language (SysML). It combines the ease of use of SysML with the precision of mathematical specification of certain aspects of the designed system. It makes the whole system specification effective, from the point of view of the time needed to create it, conciseness of the specification and the possibility of its analysis. By using EARL it is possible to specify systems both with fixed and variable structure. This was achieved by introducing a generalised system model and presenting particular structures of the system in terms of modelling block configurations adapted by using instances. FABRIC framework was created to support the implementation of EARL-based robot controllers. EARL is compatible with component based robotic middlewares (e.g., ROS and Orocos).
