  abstract = {Social robots’ software is commonly tested in a simulation due to the safety and convenience reasons as well as an environment configuration repeatability assurance. An interaction between a robot and a human requires taking a person presence and his movement abilities into consideration. The purpose of the article is to present the HuBeRo framework, which can be used to simulate human motion behaviour. The framework allows independent control of each individual’s activity, which distinguishes the presented approach from state-of-the-art, opensource solutions from the robotics domain. The article presents the framework assumptions, architecture, and an exemplary application with respect to presented scenarios.},

  abstract  = {The design, simulation and programming of robotics systems is challenging as expertise from multiple domains needs to be integrated conceptually and technically. Domain-specific modeling promises an efficient and flexible concept for developing robotics applications that copes with this challenge. It allows to raise the level of abstraction through the use of specific concepts that are closer to the respective domain concerns and easier to understand and validate. Furthermore, it focuses on increasing the level of automation, e.g. through code generation, to bridge the gap between the modeling and the implementation levels and to improve the efficiency and quality of the software development process. Within this contribution, we survey the literature available on domain-specific (modeling) languages in robotics required to realize a state-of-the-art real-world example from the RoboCup@Work competition. We classify 41 publications in the field as reference for potential DSL users. Furthermore, we analyze these contributions from a DSL-engineering viewpoint and discuss quantitative and qualitative aspects such as the methods and tools used for DSL implementation as well as their documentation status and platform integration. Finally, we conclude with some recommendations for discussion in the robotics programming and simulation community based on the insights gained with this survey.},

As the on-board robot computational resources are limited, but in some cases the demands imposed on the robot by the user are virtually limitless, the solution is to produce a~variable structure system. The task dependent part has to be exchanged, however the task governs the activities of the robot. Thus not only exchange of some task-dependent modules is required, but also supervisory responsibilities have to be switched. Such control systems are necessary in the case of robot companions, where the owner of the robot may demand from it to provide many services.},

	with other agents through communication channels. The presented code
	patterns pertain to agents with the following characteristics: deterministic
	or indeterministic, crisp or fuzzy, behavioral or deliberative. The
	formalism was instrumental in the design of MRROC++ robot programming
	framework, which has been used for producing controllers of single
	and two manipulator systems performing diverse tasks. The formalism
	introduces rigor into the discussion of the structure of embodied
	agent controllers. It is used as the means for the specification
	of the functions of the components of the control system and the
	structure of the communication links between them. This structures
	the implementation of a~programming framework, and that in turn makes
	the coding of specific controllers much easier, both from the point
	of view of dealing with the hardware configuration of the system

multiple interruptions of one task by another one. The tasks

ABSTRACT = {Some authors suggest that transitioning requirements engineering from the traditional statements in natural language with shall clauses to model-based requirements within a Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE) environment could improve communication, requirements traceability, and system decomposition, among others. Requirement elements in the Systems Modeling Language (SysML) fail to fulfill this objective, as they are really a textual requirement in natural language as a model element. Current efforts to directly leverage behavioral and structural models of the system lack an overarching theoretical framework with which to assess the adequacy of how those models are used to capture requirements. This paper presents an approach to construct true model-based requirements in SysML. The presented approach leverages some of SysML&rsquo;s behavioral and structural models and diagrams, with specific construction rules derived from Wymore&rsquo;s mathematical framework for MBSE and taxonomies of requirements and interfaces. The central proposition of the approach is that every requirement can be modeled as an input/output transformation. Examples are used to show how attributes traditionally thought of as non-functional requirements can be captured, with higher precision, as functional transformations.},

ABSTRACT = {The paper presents the issue of metamodeling of Domain-Specific Languages (DSL) for the purpose of designing complex mechatronics systems. Usually, one of the problems during the development of such projects is an interdisciplinary character of the team that is involved in this endeavour. The success of a complex machine project (e.g., Computer Numerically Controlled machine (CNC), loading crane, forestry crane) often depends on a proper communication between team members. The domain-specific modelling languages developed using one of the two approaches discussed in the work, lead to a machine design that can be carried out much more efficiently than with conventional approaches. Within the paper, the Meta-Object Facility (MOF) approach to metamodeling is presented; it is much more prevalent in modern modelling software tools than Graph-Object-Property-Relationship-Role (GOPRR). The main outcome of this work is the first presentation of researchML modelling language that is the result of more than twenty ambitious research and development projects. It is effectively used within new enterprises and leads to improved traceability of the project goals. It enables for fully-featured automatic code generation which is one of the main pillars of the agile management within mechatronic system design projects.},

For model-based engineering, model checking is a verification technique that explores all possible system states. The Aviation Scenario Definition Language is a domain-specific language designed based on a scenario development process from a model-driven engineering perspective. It aims at providing a well-structured definition language to specify departure, en route, re-route, and landing scenarios. This paper uses statecharts and a model checker for the verification of each scenario generated and uses examples to demonstrate conformance to the rules established in the statecharts to verify the logic of all future scenarios.},

ABSTRACT = {The fusion of different technologies is the base of the fourth industrial revolution. Companies are encouraged to integrate new tools in their production processes in order to improve working conditions and increase productivity and production quality. The integration between information, communication technologies and industrial automation can create highly flexible production models for products and services that can be customized through real-time interactions between consumer, production and machinery throughout the production process. The future of production, therefore, depends on increasingly intelligent machinery through the use of digital systems. The key elements for future integrated devices are intelligent systems and machines, based on human&ndash;machine interaction and information sharing. To do so, the implementation of shared languages that allow different systems to dialogue in a simple way is necessary. In this perspective, the use of advanced prototyping tools like Open-Source programming systems, the development of more detailed multibody models through the use of CAD software and the use of self-learning techniques will allow for developing a new class of machines capable of revolutionizing our companies. The purpose of this paper is to present a waypoint navigation activity of a custom Wheeled Mobile Robot (WMR) in an available simulated 3D indoor environment by using the Gazebo simulator. Gazebo was developed in 2002 at the University of Southern California. The idea was to create a high-fidelity simulator that gave the possibility to simulate robots in outdoor environments under various conditions. In particular, we wanted to test the high-performance physics Open Dynamics Engine (ODE) and the sensors feature present in Gazebo for prototype development activities. This choice was made for the possibility of emulating not only the system under analysis, but also the world in which the robot will operate. Furthermore, the integration tools available with Solidworks and Matlab-Simulink, well known commercial platforms of modelling and robotics control respectively, are also explored.},

abstract="The development of cognitive robots in ROS still lacks the support of some key components: a knowledge integration framework and a framework for autonomous mission execution. In this research chapter, we will discuss our skill-based platform SkiROS, that was developed on top of ROS in order to organize robot knowledge and its behavior. We will show how SkiROS offers the possibility to integrate different functionalities in form of skill `apps' and how SkiROS offers services for integrating these skill-apps into a consistent workspace. Furthermore, we will show how these skill-apps can be automatically executed based on autonomous, goal-directed task planning. SkiROS helps the developers to program and port their high-level code over a heterogeneous range of robots, meanwhile the minimal Graphical User Interface (GUI) allows non-expert users to start and supervise the execution. As an application example, we present how SkiROS was used to vertically integrate a robot into the manufacturing system of PSA Peugeot-Citro{\"e}n. We will discuss the characteristics of the SkiROS architecture which makes it not limited to the automotive industry but flexible enough to be used in other application areas as well. SkiROS has been developed on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS and ROS indigo and it can be downloaded at https://github.com/frovida/skiros. A demonstration video is also available at https://youtu.be/mo7UbwXW5W0.",

parameters is employed. It implies a division of the specification
into a number of items, produced using a DSL and source code
expressed in a universal programming language. The method of
generating a working agent-based system, out of its specification

abstract="Coming from the Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Semantic Web (SW) circles, ontologies are used mainly to represent domains. The Model Driven Engineering (MDE) field gave birth to Domain Specific Languages to represent a particular technical domain. Abstracting from their uses, we consider as many others researchers that ontologies and models are closer than their original fields could get to think. Furthermore, their building or development are facing the same problems. They are costly and need experts' interviews in order to grasp specific knowledge and structure it. Likewise, ontologies and DSL can benefit from each other domains in reusing construction methodologies and even reusing knowledge modelled in another format. In this paper we first present the ontologies and DSL definition we use and some methodologies of development enabling the reuse of knowledge (as alignment, fusion). We then present how we propose to reuse the knowledge of a robotic ontology to develop robotic DSLs within the PROTEUS project in order to inject ready-made domain information to the DSL.",

abstract = { Autonomous service robots will have to understand vaguely described tasks, such as “set the table” or “clean up”. Performing such tasks as intended requires robots to fully, precisely, and appropriately parameterize their low-level control programs. We propose knowledge processing as a computational resource for enabling robots to bridge the gap between vague task descriptions and the detailed information needed to actually perform those tasks in the intended way. In this article, we introduce the KnowRobknowledge processing system that is specifically designed to provide autonomous robots with the knowledge needed for performing everyday manipulation tasks. The system allows the realization of “virtual knowledge bases”: collections of knowledge pieces that are not explicitly represented but computed on demand from the robot’s internal data structures, its perception system, or external sources of information. This article gives an overview of the different kinds of knowledge, the different inference mechanisms, and interfaces for acquiring knowledge from external sources, such as the robot’s perception system, observations of human activities, Web sites on the Internet, as well as Web-based knowledge bases for information exchange between robots. We evaluate the system’s scalability and present different integrated experiments that show its versatility and comprehensiveness. }

abstract = "Starting from the paper by Nash and Sofer (1990), we propose a heuristic adaptive truncation criterion for the inner iterations within linesearch-based truncated Newton methods. Our aim is to possibly avoid “over-solving” of the Newton equation, based on a comparison between the predicted reduction of the objective function and the actual reduction obtained. A numerical experience on unconstrained optimization problems highlights a satisfactory effectiveness and robustness of the adaptive criterion proposed, when a residual-based truncation criterion is selected."

abstract = "In this paper, we report data and experiments related to the research article entitled “An adaptive truncation criterion, for linesearch-based truncated Newton methods in large scale nonconvex optimization” by Caliciotti et al. [1]. In particular, in Caliciotti et al. [1], large scale unconstrained optimization problems are considered by applying linesearch-based truncated Newton methods. In this framework, a key point is the reduction of the number of inner iterations needed, at each outer iteration, to approximately solving the Newton equation. A novel adaptive truncation criterion is introduced in Caliciotti et al. [1] to this aim. Here, we report the details concerning numerical experiences over a commonly used test set, namely CUTEst (Gould et al., 2015) [2]. Moreover, comparisons are reported in terms of performance profiles (Dolan and Moré, 2002) [3], adopting different parameters settings. Finally, our linesearch-based scheme is compared with a renowned trust region method, namely TRON (Lin and Moré, 1999) [4]."
